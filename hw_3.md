## Problem Statement
Historical economics currently uses string fuzzy matching techniques to link records together. Current practices use
some measure of string distance like Jaro-Winkler or SOUNDEX. However, these tools do not fully represent the true
distance of names from each other because nicknames can sometimes look nothing like the full name. We propose using
machine learning techniques to create a name vector space that accurately represents the similarity of names.

## Data
We will use FamilySearch data to approach the problem. We currently have data on links between censuses generated by users
on FamilySearch. This also creates links between names in the census that can be used to show which names are the same.

## Analysis
A simple approach is to say that any names linked between censuses are the same. However, noise in the data complicates this
since people often switch between their middle and first names or go by nicknames that have nothing to do with the actual name.
Therefore, we will use numerous tools to deal with this

### Network Analysis
A method for blocking names is to use community structure analysis on the implicit network in the FamilySearch data. 
If we treat each name as a node in a graph and links in the census as weighted edges, we obtain a network. If two names
are similar, they should have a dense edge between them and share links to other names that are similar. Using community
structure techniques like modularity maximization and statistical inference, we can identify communities of names that
are similar enough to be considered the same.

### K nearest neighbors
Another simple process is to identify distance between names using K nearest neighbors.

### Creating Word Vectors in a Name Space
Words vectors are numerical representations of strings along several dimensions. Example dimensions in a name space could
include the gender of the name, the origin of the name, similarity of names, etc.
